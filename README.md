## 📊 Dashboard Pages & Contents  

### 🏠 Homepage  
The homepage provides an introduction to the project and displays key API and dataset information used in building the dashboard. It serves as a navigation hub for exploring the rest of the report.

### 📈 Overview Page  
The overview page highlights key performance insights, including:

- **Top 5 Fastest Cars**  
  Displays the five fastest cars in the dataset based on performance metrics.

- **Fuel Type Distribution**  
  Shows the distribution of different fuel types across the dataset to understand fuel usage trends.

- **Top 5 Cars by Horsepower**  
  Highlights vehicles with the highest horsepower, showcasing performance-focused models.

- **Top 5 Companies by Average Horsepower**  
  Compares manufacturers based on average horsepower to identify brands that emphasize high-performance vehicles.

### 🧪 Model View (Performance Relationships)  
This page focuses on exploring relationships between key performance variables:

- **Acceleration vs Horsepower**  
  Visualizes how horsepower relates to vehicle acceleration and highlights performance trade-offs.

- **Speed vs Torque**  
  Examines the relationship between torque and top speed to better understand engine performance.

- **Average Specifications by Engine Type (Table)**
